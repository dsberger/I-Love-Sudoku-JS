# I Love Sudoku

[Sudoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku) is a puzzle-solving game. The object is to fill a 9x9 grid with a single number in each cell, with some numbers provided initially. A number can appear only once in any row, column, or 3x3 subgrid.

"I Love Sudoku" solves these puzzles. It is consistently able to solve "Easy" and "Medium" puzzles from [Web Sudoku](http://www.websudoku.com/), and about 2/3 of "Hard" puzzles. The next step is to make a graph solver for the hard cases.

## Usage

1. Click on the numbers in the boxes and watch as the puzzle solves itself!
2. Clicking a small number marks the cell as that value.
3. Clicking on a solved value erases it and resets the board.
